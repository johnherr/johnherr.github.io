[Predicting Patent Rejections with NLP](https://johnherr.github.io/Predicting-Rejections-to-Patent-Claims-Under-101/)

*Trained a model to predict rejections under U.S.C. § 101 for claims directed to “abstract ideas.” Claim text was vectorized using word embeddings, and a random forest classifier was used for the final prediction. The final model proved to be 96% accurate on the balanced test set of 32,000 claims, identifying 94.5% of the applications that were rejected.*
